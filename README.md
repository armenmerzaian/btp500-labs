## Coding Lab Work

### Lab 1

Implemented the following:

- An iterative algorithm for calculating the factorial of a given unsigned integer
- An iterative algorithm for calculating the power of a number given a input for the base (unsigned int) and an input for the exponent (unsigned int)
- An iterative algorithm for calculating the nth fibonacci number given an unsigned integer

### Lab 2

Implemented the following:

- A recursive version of the factorial algorithm from the previous lab
- A recursive version of the power algorithm from the previous lab
- A recursive version of the fibonacci algorithm from the previous lab

### Lab 3

Implemented the following:

- A doubly linked list featuring standard operations such as push_front(), push_back(), pop_front(), and pop_back()
- A sentinel-based doubly linked list featuring standard operations such as push_front(), push_back(), pop_front(), and pop_back()

### Lab 4

Implemented the following:

- An iterator algorithm to provide uniform access across the two linked lists from the previous lab
- A const-iterator algorithm to provide uniform access across the two linked lists from the previous lab

### Lab 7

Implemented the following:

- An algorithm to remove a given node in a binary search tree
- An algorithm to calculate the depth of a given node in a binary search tree
- An algorithm to perform a deep-copy of a binary search tree

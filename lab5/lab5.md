## Simple sorts

### which algorithm did you find easiest to understand?

The easiest algorithm for me to understand is the Bubblestort. This is because the algorithm makes many small iterative changes to the array,
which makes it extremely inefficient, however modelling it, and visually displaying the sort is simple to comprehend.
	
### which algorithm seemed to fastest for completing the sort?

The fastest simple algorithm seemed to the insertion sort. However, after analyzing the Big-O of all three simple algorithms, it is 
clear that mathematically they all perform in the same quadratic time complexity for a worst-case scenerio. Therefore they are all equally 		inefficient.  


## Merging Unsorted lists

	* how long did this take
	* did you make any mistakes along the way (did you choose the wrong number and had to move things around)?
		* How many times? 


## Merging Sorted lists

	* how long did this take
	* did you make any mistakes along the way (did you choose the wrong number and had to move things around)?
		* How many times?

## Sorting larger data sets

|Team member | Sorting time|
|---|---|
| Armen Merzaian |  |
| Jacky Dai |  |
| Team member 3 |  |

What was fastest time?


Describe the algorithm produced by the team member with fastest time.


## Partitioning

* how long did it take to partition the data set?


## Sorting the small piles

* how long did it take for you to sort all of the little piles?

## Putting it together

* As a team discuss things that helped soft the papers... what was useful? what was fast to do?  What was slow?
* As a team come up with a description of how best to sort a set of numbers on paper.
* Mix up all your numbers and have each member of the team perform the sort you did.  How long did it take?

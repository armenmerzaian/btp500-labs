## LaTex Formulas

Put your formulas here

Hypotenus of a right angle triangle:
$$c = { \sqrt{a^2+b^2} }$$

Geometric series: 
$$\sum_{i=0}^{n}ar^i$$

Arithmetic series closed form:
$$\sum_{i=1}^{n}i=1+2+3+4...n/$$
$$\={n(n+1)\over 2}$$

What aspect of the lab did you find to be the hardest?

I tried to test the Factorial algorithm provided in the course notes [here](https://catherine-leung.gitbook.io/data-strutures-and-algorithms/algorithms-analysis/how-to-do-an-analysis-in-5-steps).
It didn't work until I had to change the return datatype for the function from unsigned int to unsigned long long to account for the large digits produced by the testing program.


What do you think about CodeSpaces? What did you like/not like about Codespaces?

CodeSpaces is very interesting. I like that I am able to access my code remotely and develop in the same enviornment regardless of system. I also like that codespaces uses VSCode on Web which makes the experience easy and familiar with the benefit of adding any extenstion I wish. 

However, with C++ coding I am used to using JetBrains CLion as my IDE, and therefore I miss some of the functions of that software.
